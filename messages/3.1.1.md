#### Fix Missing CLI Dependency and Patch for Browser Stream Polyfill

  The CLI `package.json` was missing a dependency to `yargs`. The [`stream` polyfill](https://github.com/browserify/stream-browserify) used by both Webpack and Browserify improperly pushes `null` and emits an `'end'` event during the call to `.destroy()` -- the same bug exists for node.js <v10. This patch includes an overriding destroy implementation for the stream polyfill when bundled.
