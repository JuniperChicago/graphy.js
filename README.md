`graphy` is a collection of RDF libraries for JavaScript developers that focuses on performance and usability. 

## [See API Documentation](https://graphy.link/api)

## Features
 - [Textual Content Handlers](content.textual)
   - **Read & write** RDF documents using streams. Includes support for:
     - N-Triples (.nt)
     - N-Quads (.nq)
     - Turtle (.ttl)
     - TriG (.trig)
 - [DatasetTree package](util.dataset.tree)
   - Compute the union, intersection, and difference between two RDF graphs.
   - Compare two RDF graphs for equivalence, inclusion, and disjointness using the [RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm](https://json-ld.github.io/normalization/spec/).
